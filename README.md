# FitnesSkopje 
###### Web application for finding fitness centres in the heart of Macedonia

## Short Description of the Project
The purpose of this web application is to encourage all fitness newbies and gym enthusiasts to find the perfect workout space suitable for them in just a few clicks. This web application contains all of the fitness centres available in Skopje, as well as information about each business. 

The users can easily select any of the offered fitness centers and view their location on a map, find directions to that address, and they can also contact the fitness centers for additional information. Our web application provides a search tab for the userâ€™s convenience. Moreover, the user can narrow its search results by adding filters. Each user is allowed to create his own profile with personal data and information. By being registered as a user, you can leave reviews, feedback and comments for each and every fitness centre. Certainly, there is a proper security system implemented to guarantee an adequate level of protection for all users.
